	Short: "Remove old snapshots according to rotation schedule",
	Long: `
Forget removes old backups according to a rotation schedule. It both flags 
snapshots for removal as well as deletes (prunes) the actual old snapshot from
the repository.

Examples:
restic-unattended forget --keep-last 5
Keep the 5 most recent snapshots

restic-unattended forget --keep-daily 7
Keep the most recent backup for each of the last 7 days
